# [Echelon Fitness Project](https://github.com/SmithBWare89/echelon-project) - [Deployed](https://echelon-project.web.app/#/)

## Description
This project is related to the interview process for Echelon Fitness and is intended to be a demonstration of my ability to create a single page application using Vue 3. In this project you'll find that I use Vue 3's `composition API`, the `provide/inject` methods to pass prop data and manage state, `ref/reactive`, `template refs`, and the Element Plus UI library to make this an easy to use.
